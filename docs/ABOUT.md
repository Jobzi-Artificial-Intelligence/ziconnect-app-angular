# Our Project

Jobzi has an unique AI technology to collect, deduplicate and normalize job & education data to build predictive models

We also use Machine Learning techniques to build explainable models to predict connectivity at schools. To find the model(s) that will be implemented in our service we will invest in feature selection/engineering and we will also carry-on experiments with a number of possibilities ranging from classical models (Learners) as Decision Trees and SVM's to more recent ones, including Gradient Boosting Methods and Deep Learning.

## Input data

- Job Openings
- Economic Index
- Telecommunications Data
- Education & School Data
- Development Index
- Research Institutes
- Government Reports

## Predictive models

- Schools Connectivity
- Social Economy Impacts with employability


# How we are helping

## Interactive maps

Explore schools connectivity data, schools connectivity prediction and educational performance given to connectivity generated by our models on an interactive map.

## Analysis Tool

Allows users to download our data, execute our models, visualize the results/analysis and also download them.

# About us

We are an AI technology and data intelligence startup company focused on the job and education market.
