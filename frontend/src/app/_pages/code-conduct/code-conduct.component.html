  <!-- SCOPE -->
  <section>
    <h3>Scope</h3>
    <p>Jobzi Code of Conduct applies to all community spaces and in addition, applies when an individual is officially
      representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official
      e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an
      online or offline event.</p>

    <p>This guidance applies to actions taken outside of this space, and that have a negative impact on community
      harmony and interaction with each other. Another important aspect is that this document has the objective to
      define expectations for participation in Jobzi-managed open-source communities, as well as procedures for
      reporting unacceptable hostile or aggressive behaviors. The Jobzi team is aware and committed to welcoming and
      inspiring all community. Anyone that intends to violate or break this code of conduct can be banned from it.</p>

      orientation. We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, inclusive, and healthy
