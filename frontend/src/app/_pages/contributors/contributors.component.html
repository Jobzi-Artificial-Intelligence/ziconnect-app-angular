  <!-- ABOUT COMMUNITY -->
  <section>
    <h3>About the community</h3>
    <p>We are currently building an intelligence platform that uses data-sets inputs (connectivity, social, economic and
      employability) to predict social impacts in a region due to connectivity investments. We believe connectivity
      leverages access to new opportunities and better education that impacts people’s futures. on a project that
      addresses hate speech by providing victims and observers micro-interventions that help them choose strategic
      silence and counter narratives to combat perpetrators in a healthy and productive way.</p>

    <p>We will also offer techniques to provide instant relief to people that have been attacked to help them overcome
      this challenging situation and prevent mental wellbeing issues.</p>

    <p>
      And we will create a Chat Story or Chat Game to raise awareness about the growth of Hate Speech and all the
      possibilities we have as a community to stop this trend from scaling by changing our attitude and online behavior.
    </p>

  <!-- PROBLEM -->
  <section>
    <h3>Problem to solve and why apply Data Sciense method?</h3>
    <p>By identifying schools with low or no connectivity we may help to bring connectivity to them and, hence, changing
      the destiny of their students by including them in the digital world and giving them access to information.</p>

    <p>Digital education will help people´s development by improving their employability and giving them better chances
      for new opportunities. Education is the best tool to change the world.</p>

    <p>
      We use data science techniques to collect and deduplicate a huge amount of information (job pots for example) from
      many different sources. In particular, deduplication is a non-trivial task so that modern techniques are required
      to understand and extract information from data in a highly scalable way.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our solution uses Machine Learning techniques, in particular, those developed in the subfield of Natural Language
      Processing, to extract and normalize relevant entities that are present in many sources like job descriptions as
      job titles.
    </p>

    <p>
      We also use Machine Learning techniques to build explainable models to predict connectivity at schools. To find
      the model(s) that will be implemented in our service we will invest in feature selection/engineering and we will
      also carry-on experiments with a number of possibilities ranging from classical models (Learners) as Decision
      Trees and SVM's to more recent ones, including Gradient Boosting Methods and Deep Learning.

  <!-- REPORTING BUG -->
  <section>
    <h3>Reporting Bugs</h3>
    <h4>Before Submitting a Bug Report</h4>
    <p>A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to
      investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the
      following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Make sure that you are using the latest version.</li>
      <li>Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using incompatible environment
        components/versions.</li>
      <li>To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check
        if
        there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in the <a
          href="https://github.com/Jobzi-Artificial-Intelligence/unicef-project/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Abug+"
          target="_blank">bug tracker</a>.</li>
      <li>Collect information about the bug.</li>
      <li>Stack trace.</li>
      <li>OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM).</li>
      <li>Browser version</li>
      <li>Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with older versions?</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs including sensitive information to
          the
          issue tracker, or elsewhere in public. Instead sensitive bugs must be sent by email to <a
            href="mailto:contato@jobzi.com?subject=Jobzi | Unicef - Schools Connectivity">contato@jobzi.com</a></i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>


    <p>We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Open an <a href="https://github.com/Jobzi-Artificial-Intelligence/unicef-project/issues/new"
          target="_blank">Issue</a>.</li>
      <li>Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.</li>
      <li>Please provide as much context as possible and describe the reproduction steps that someone else can follow to
        recreate the issue on their own. This usually includes your code. For good bug reports you should isolate the
        problem and create a reduced test case.</li>
      <li>Provide the information you collected in the previous section.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Once it's filed:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The project team will label the issue accordingly.</li>
      <li>A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. If there are no reproduction steps or
        no
        obvious way to reproduce the issue, the team will ask you for those steps.</li>
      <li>If the team is able to reproduce the issue, it will be marked <span class="f-weight-500">Bug</span>, and the
        issue will be left to be
        implemented by someone.</li>
    </ul>

  <!-- ENHANCEMENTS -->
  <section>
    <h3>Suggesting Enhancements</h3>
    <p>This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for CONTRIBUTING.md, <span
        class="f-weight-500">including completely
        new features and minor improvements to existing functionality</span>. Following these guidelines will help
      maintainers
      and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.</p>

    <h4>Before Submitting an Enhancement</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Make sure that you are using the latest version.</li>
      <li>Read the <a href="https://github.com/Jobzi-Artificial-Intelligence/unicef-project/blob/master/README.md"
          target="_blank">documentation</a> carefully and find out if the functionality is already covered, maybe by an
        individual configuration.</li>
      <li>Perform a <a href="https://github.com/Jobzi-Artificial-Intelligence/unicef-project/issues"
          target="_blank">search</a> to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to
        the
        existing issue instead of opening a new one.</li>
      <li>Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It’s up to you to make a strong case
        to convince the project’s developers of the merits of this feature. Keep in mind that we want features that will
        be useful to the majority of our users and not just a small subset.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?</h4>
    <p>Enhancement suggestions are tracked as <a
        href="https://github.com/Jobzi-Artificial-Intelligence/unicef-project/issues" target="_blank">GitHub issues</a>.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Use a <span class="f-weight-500">clear and descriptive title</span> for the issue to identify the suggestion.
      </li>
      <li>
        Provide a <span class="f-weight-500">step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement</span> in as many
        details as possible.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="f-weight-500">Describe the current behavior</span> and <span class="f-weight-500">explain which
          behavior you expected to see instead</span> and why. At this point you
        can also tell which alternatives do not work for you.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="f-weight-500">Explain why this enhancement would be useful</span> to most CONTRIBUTING.md users.
        You may also want to point out the other projects that solved it better and which could serve as inspiration.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- PULL REQUESTS -->
  <section>
    <h3>Opening a pull request</h3>
    <p>You should usually open a pull request in the following situations:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Submit trivial fixes (for example, a typo, a broken link or an obvious error).</li>
      <li>Start work on a contribution that was already asked for, or that you've already discussed, in an issue</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Here's how to submit a pull request</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="f-weight-500">Fork the repository</span> and clone it locally. Connect your local to the original
        “upstream” repository by adding
        it as a remote. Pull in changes from “upstream” often so that you stay up to date so that when you submit your
        pull request, merge conflicts will be less likely. (See more detailed instructions <a
          href="https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/" target="_blank">here</a>.)
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="f-weight-500">Create a branch</span> for your edits. Make sure the branch name has this
        structure: <i>&lt;issue_id&gt;-&lt;short_issue_title&gt;</i>, for example: 1-update-contributing-md
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="f-weight-500">Reference any relevant issues</span> or supporting documentation in your PR (for
        example, “Closes #1.”)
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="f-weight-500">Include screenshots of the before and after</span> if your changes include
        differences in HTML/CSS. Drag and drop the images into the body of your pull request.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="f-weight-500">Test your changes!</span> Run your changes against any existing tests if they exist
        and create new ones when needed. Make sure your changes don't break the project.
      </li>
      <li>
        After you submit your pull request, verify that all <a
          href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/" target="_blank">status checks</a> are passing.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>What if the status checks are failing?</h4>
    <p>If a status check is failing, and you believe that the failure is unrelated to your change, please leave a
      comment on the pull request explaining why you believe the failure is unrelated. A maintainer will re-run the
      status check for you. If we conclude that the failure was a false positive, then we will open an issue to track
      that problem with our status check suite.</p>

    <p>While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may
      ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately
      accepted.</p>
