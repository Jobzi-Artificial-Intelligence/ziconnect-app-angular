## 1: Guiding Principles

This project-charter file provides the content and information necessary to identify the project in the context of its purpose, funding, resource requirements and approval. This document target audience is the major departmental stakeholders and decision makers in the leadership team.

## 2: Scope

Jobzi has a considerable knowledge and experience to provide AI NLP solution designed to guide, contribute and merge the Job and Education market. As a part of this experience we are helping the Unicef and Giga a platform and AI prediction models to identify Internet availability in Brazilian schools using geographical data and information on employability for the schools' region.

## 3: Relationship with Unicef Foundation and Giga Company

Additionally, we want to promote the Education towards employability, giving institutions the data and tools to improve their results. With Unicef Innovation Fund and Giga Project our objective it to leverage the inclusion of young people to better education and more opportunities through internet connectivity, as the world is facing a learning crisis.

        - Determine licensing strategy for Open Source intellectual property (i.e. permissive or copyleft). Apply an Open Source Initiative-approved license to a public source code repository
        - Create a project charter. Project charters should include: vision statement, mission statement, community statement, licensing strategy, and identification of key trademarks
        - Create READMEs (in English) for all public repositories. READMEs should include: overview of specific repo, developer environment instructions (i.e. how to set software up), note about how repo connects into overall product, list of any Open Source software used to create product (including tools and frameworks)
        - Create a public, standalone Open Source documentation website that corresponds to a public git repository. Use tools to set up automated deployments of HTML documentation site from public source code repository (e.g. with Continuous Integration)
        - Follow the Pull Request Workflow when contributing code into your Open Source repositories.

- Quarter 2
    - Milestone 1 [Updated model to predict internet connectivity on Brazilian schools, based on information from GIGA, regional employability data, and additional data from external sources , (backend and frontend)]

- Internal test coverage for all of the above
- Documentation including (but not limited to):
  - Website ([https://unicef.jobzi.com](https://unicef.jobzi.com)) contents and design
  - Test-writing and test-organizing APIs
  - Command-line execution and options
  - Browser-based execution and options

  - [Contribution guide](https://github.com/Jobzi-Artificial-Intelligence/unicef-project/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- General support for multiple levels of tests, including (but not limited to):
  - Unit tests
  - Integration tests
  - Functional/end-to-end tests
  - Operational readiness tests
- Tool configuration for project tests, build, documentation or website deployment
- Angular and additional frameworks (e.g Karma), if needed
- Third-party service integrations (e.g., bots, CI servers, SCM)
- Project-endorsed spaces for collaboration (chat rooms, mailing lists, forums, etc.)

### 4.2 Out-Of-Scope

- Use within unmaintained versions of Node.js
- Use within browsers not meeting a threshold decided upon by maintainers
- Certain classes of contributions:
  - Bug fixes or enhancements without associated test coverage 
  - Features having limited general-purpose use (as determined by maintainers)
  - Bug fixes which "break" more users than are affected by the bug itself, _regardless_ of "correctness"
  - Breaking changes to API without demonstrated need, especially those which would cause correct, currently-passing tests to fail
  - Changes that significantly negatively impact performance without demonstrated need
  - Code reviews, issue comments or pull requests which are dogmatic, demanding, or excessively critical as to discourage contributions by others
  - Those which violate the Jobzi's [Code of Conduct]
