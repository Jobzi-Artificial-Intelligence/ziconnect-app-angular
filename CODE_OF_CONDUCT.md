# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Scope

Jobzi Code of Conduct applies to all community spaces and in addition, applies when an individual is officially 
representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, 
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

This guidance applies to actions taken outside of this space, and that have a negative impact on community harmony 
and interaction with each other. Another important aspect is that this document has the objective to define expectations 
for participation in Jobzi-managed open-source communities, as well as procedures for reporting unacceptable hostile or 
aggressive behaviors. The Jobzi team is aware and committed to welcoming and inspiring all community. Anyone that intends 
to violate or break this code of conduct can be banned from it.

## Jobzi Commitment

We as members, contributors, and leaders are committed to encouraging interaction in our community to a harassment-free experience 
for everyone, no matter the contexts they have like education, socio-economic status, race, religion, gender identity and expression, 
nationality, personal appearance, or sexual identity and orientation. We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, 
welcoming, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Jobzi Standards

We believe in the behavior examples below that can potentialize a positive environment for the community:

* Direct on what is best not just for an individual context, but for all community;
* Demonstrating to be respectful and politeness toward other people;
* Have the sense to accept constructive feedback;
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience;

Unacceptable behavior includes (can be banned from the community):

* Comment,s posts, and discussions about harassment in public or private sessions in the community;
* The use or sharing of sexualized language, terms, or contents with sexual attention;
* Personal or political attacks, and encourage people to send others' private pieces of information, like telephone numbers, 
emails, and physical addresses without their explicit permission


## Applicable Responsibilities

We want to encourage the Community leaders to be responsible for supporting guiding and response and enforcing our standards 
of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any inappropriate, offensive, or harmful behavior.

Besides that, the Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, 
wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for m
oderation decisions when appropriate.

## Reporting

The Jobzi team encourages any contributor or anyone in the community to resolve or handle the issues on their own whenever possible. 
In addition, instances of harassing, abusive, or otherwise unacceptable patterns or behavior must be reported to the community leaders 
responsible for enforcement at support@jobzi.com. Issues related to the community and topics about the platform can be achieved 
at support@jobzi.com.

Your report will be handled in accordance with the issue resolution process described in the Code of Conduct FAQ. All project and community 
leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
