# Git workflow

The objective of this document is to guide developers and community in how to implement, create and update the source code pipeline.

## Abstract

The use of PULL-REQUEST (PR) is mandotory for new features to move up the ladder:

    - Staging > Release > Master

The direct merges or fetch can be applicable down in this sequence:

    - Master > Hotfix > Staging

PR to "Staging" and "Master" branches must have the code review and approval of 1 or 2 peer developers
