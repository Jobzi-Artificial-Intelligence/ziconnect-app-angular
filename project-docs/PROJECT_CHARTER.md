## 1: Guiding Principles

This project-charter file provides the content and information necessary to identify the project in the context of its purpose, funding, resource requirements and approval. This document target audience is the major departmental stakeholders and decision makers in the leadership team.

## 2: Scope

Jobzi has a considerable knowledge and experience to provide AI NLP solution designed to guide, contribute and merge the Job and Education market. As a part of this experience we are helping the Unicef and Giga a platform and AI prediction models to identify Internet availability in Brazilian schools using geographical data and information on employability for the schools' region.

## 3: Relationship with Unicef Foundation and Giga Company

Additionally, we want to promote the Education towards employability, giving institutions the data and tools to improve their results. With Unicef Innovation Fund and Giga Project our objective it to leverage the inclusion of young people to better education and more opportunities through internet connectivity, as the world is facing a learning crisis.

        - Determine licensing strategy for Open Source intellectual property (i.e. permissive or copyleft). Apply an Open Source Initiative-approved license to a public source code repository
        - Create a project charter. Project charters should include: vision statement, mission statement, community statement, licensing strategy, and identification of key trademarks
        - Create READMEs (in English) for all public repositories. READMEs should include: overview of specific repo, developer environment instructions (i.e. how to set software up), note about how repo connects into overall product, list of any Open Source software used to create product (including tools and frameworks)
        - Create a public, standalone Open Source documentation website that corresponds to a public git repository. Use tools to set up automated deployments of HTML documentation site from public source code repository (e.g. with Continuous Integration)
        - Follow the Pull Request Workflow when contributing code into your Open Source repositories.

- Quarter 2
    - Milestone 1 [Updated model to predict internet connectivity on Brazilian schools, based on information from GIGA, regional employability data, and additional data from external sources , (backend and frontend)]
        - Acquisiton of data from additional sources
        - Feature selection
        - Model testing
        - Model selection
        - Data summarizing
        - Update webpage
    - Milestone 2 [Meeting Open Source Contractual Requirement]
        - MUST have a OSI-approved license distributed with public source code repositories by end of Q2
        - Create contributing guidelines for all Open Source repositories. Explain how someone makes a contribution to the projects. Add to documentation website created in previous quarter
        - Create public tickets/issues that correspond to planned features and known bugs/problems with Open Source repositories
        - Establish an Open Source quality assurance process. Explore unit testing frameworks for front-end/back-end software, if applicable. Document user stories and test cases for games, if applicable. Document data structures and algorithm decisions for data science, if applicable.
        - Add either developer or user documentation to the Open Source documentation site. (Hint: Developer docs often include API docs, architecture or system state diagrams, or deployment guides)

### 4.2 Out-Of-Scope

- Use within unmaintained versions of Node.js
- Use within browsers not meeting a threshold decided upon by maintainers
- Certain classes of contributions:
  - Bug fixes or enhancements without associated test coverage 
  - Features having limited general-purpose use (as determined by maintainers)
  - Bug fixes which "break" more users than are affected by the bug itself, _regardless_ of "correctness"
  - Breaking changes to API without demonstrated need, especially those which would cause correct, currently-passing tests to fail
  - Changes that significantly negatively impact performance without demonstrated need
  - Code reviews, issue comments or pull requests which are dogmatic, demanding, or excessively critical as to discourage contributions by others
  - Those which violate the Jobzi's [Code of Conduct]
